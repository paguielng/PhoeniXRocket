# BerryRocket example code for BR Micro-Avionic

This code is the simplest code embedded in rocket.
It acquires acceleration on Y axis and starts recording when >2g (time, acceleration Y, barometer, temperature).
The buzzer is used to indicate the state of the rocket (before flight, after take-off).

## Key Features

- Work with BR Micro-Sensor or GY87 sensor board
- Humain-readable data text file
- Detect the take-off based on IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Buzzer management class

## Educational Purpose
This program is designed to serve as a foundational tool for both **classroom use** and **amateur developers** looking to explore programming concepts. It provides a basic framework that can be expanded upon, encouraging experimentation, learning, and further development about rocketry avionic.

The aim of this project is not to deliver a complete, polished product, but rather to offer a flexible starting point for:

- **Students**: This program can be used in educational settings as a sandbox for trying out new ideas, concepts, and approaches to problem-solving.
- **Amateur Developers**: If you're new to programming or looking to sharpen your skills, this project serves as a simple foundation to practice coding, modify features, and test new ideas.

We encourage users to:
- **Experiment with the code**: Modify the existing functionality or add new elements to deepen your understanding.
- **Learn through trial and error**: This is an opportunity to practice coding in a low-stakes environment.
- **Collaborate and share**: Whether in a classroom or a hobbyist group, discussing your changes and insights helps everyone learn more effectively.

By engaging with this base program, both students and amateurs can grow their understanding of programming concepts while gaining practical experience through experimentation.
